  "Accessors are separated by dots like {{ foo.bar.0 }}
  which gets translated into (get-in context-map [:foo :bar 0]). So you
  can nest vectors and maps in your context-map.

  Filters can be applied by separating then from the accessor
  with pipes: {{ foo|lower|capitalize }}. They are applied one after
  the other from left to right. Arguments can be passed to a filter
  separated by colons: {{ foo|pluralize:y:ies }}. If an argument includes
  spaces you can enclose it with doublequotes or colons: {{ foo|join:\", \" }}.

  You can escape doublequotes inside doublequotes. And you can put colons
  inside doublequotes which will be ignored for the purpose of separating
  arguments."
